# Nomad Travels üè† üó∫Ô∏è

Come! Let's go places!

## Description

This Web App uses Typescript everywhere(both frontend & backend).

### Frontend Tech

- [reactjs] as the main UI library.
- [ant-design] as the CSS component library to create visually-appealing UI.
- [apollo-client] for fetching GraphQL query & mutating data from and to the server.

### Backend Tech

- [expressjs] framework on top of the nodejs] runtime.
- [apollo-server] for serving data to the client.
- [mongodb-atlas] for the database.It's free and awesome.
- [cloudinary] for storing all the image files.
- [google-oauth-2.0] for authenticating users.
- [google-geocoding-api] for resolving addressses of the listings.

### Deployment

I had initially planned to deploy this using [docker] on a EC2 instance.But later changed my mind to [heroku]. Btw the code includes the Dockerfile if you plan to do.

## Getting Started

### Installing

- Since all the above mentioned services requires test API and ID keys, please go ahead and signup for these accounts and get the keys.
- Rename the sample.env files to .env in both the frontend and backend directories and add the test keys in it.

### Dependencies

- Just run `yarn` or `yarn install` in both the frontend and backend directories to install all the necessary dependancies.

### Running the website locally

- Just run `yarn dev` in both the frontend and backend directories to start the local development servers.

### That's it. Have fun üòÉ
